A simple tool to get citations for NSCF institution datasets published to GBIF.

Before running this, make sure the datasets in nscfDataset.js are up to date. 

TODO: get stats for downloads
TODO: once we're all using identifiers, use the institution identifiers to get their dataset to get their downloads and citations
TODO: send all the API calls in parallel - there aren't that many, GBIF will still be our friends afterwards...
